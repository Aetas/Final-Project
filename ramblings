If I am to use hashing for mountain lookup, I'll likely need to use inheritance to access the hash lookup.
  Maybe encapsulation if it is to return the mountain in the graph.
    On a similar line of thought, does it matter if the same address is linked to two different structures with different access?
    Probably not for this assignment.
      Since the mem address is all I need, I don't actually think encaps. will be needed for this assignment.

Any advantage to polymorphism?
  Maybe. What functions would they have in common?
    Mayhaps to separate private and public things, since inheritance don't give a f**k.
  This seems like a perfect way to land myself squarely (eyyy) in the diamond problem.

classes that I'm likely looking at;
virtual class polyMoMo (?)
graphPapa : public polyMomo
graphChitlet : public graphPapa
hashMama  : public polyMomo
hashChitlet : public hashMama

It might be better to encaps two tables in one graph since I think this more than the hash classes will be more of a direct compare.
  it would be easy to override the call types if inherited though. As far as readability and coding goes, its not much different
Hash will be more of an inheritance simply because one holds a hash table in each slot while the other holds graph locations
  I also prefer depth over breadth with my classes since it's easier to layer data access/permeability that way.
    no sphagletti pls.

***I might just remove the nested graph bit. Not because of difficulty, but there isn't really any reason to have
a graph of something that has ambiguous borders, and thus no way to weight the edges, or even make edges.
Probably splitting up edges and information into two files. Maybe both binary. Meh.

**UPDATE:
I did remove the nested graph bit and I am quite proud of myself for removing needlessly complicated B.S.
when it is so easy to just keep it because it is cool and fun + wow factor. But it was ultimately useless,
so it would wow exactly nobody I would be trying to impress.¯\_(ツ)_/¯
